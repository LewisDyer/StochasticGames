# Week 1 Status Report - 02/10/2020

Project management

* Agree regular time for meetings (keep in mind tutorials on alternating weeks) - Wednesday/Thursday would be best.
* What should I prepare before/after meetings? Say a weekly status report and minutes - probably add these on Teams
* Version control - use a git repository, probably public on GitHub? Can probably be relatively lightweight

Planning:

* I tried coming up with a week-by-week plan for the project, but I struggled a lot with this at this point - probably too early to go that granular

* Broadly grouped work into three main phases:
    - Research
    - Development
    - Analysis

Downloaded PRISM and PRISM-games, both load on my machine but I haven't done anything with them yet.

* What's the difference between them?
* Is PRISM a pre-requisite for PRISM-games?
* I noticed there were multiple [tutorials](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/tutorial/) for PRISM - my current thinking is Part 1 and Part 2 will be most useful, and I should at least complete these before next week. But I'm not sure how useful the other parts will be

Ideas for games

* Tried coming up with some ideas, but I think right now I'm not sure what makes a game *interesting* (yet feasible) to model/analyse. I have one idea though:
* Most of my background research should focus on different examples of stochastic games, in order to find an interesting game to model - I think I'm still thinking of a "game" in the everyday sense.
