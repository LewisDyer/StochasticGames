# Week 23 Status Report - 23/03/21

This week, I've written up my results for Shut the Box and uploaded the most recent dissertation version to Overleaf. Most of the specific dissertation questions are there, but I also have a few more general questions.

# Questions

* This follows on from last week's question on PRISM snippets, but I haven't mentioned PRISM very much during the case study itself and I'm not sure if that's a good idea. My thinking is that PRISM is mainly a tool to allow for analysis, so the exact details of how results are calculated isn't too relevant during the case study.
* I've found that most of my results have been used, but not all of them - in particular I haven't considered too many variants of Shut the Box, instead focusing on a few to highlight a particular "narrative", and making sure everything in the dissertation has a clear purpose.
* Also, I've found so far that focusing each case study around one particular aspect of game design (e.g for Shut the Box, whether a simple strategy is "too good" to justify learning a complex one) helps maintain purpose within the case study.
* When it comes to the future work section, I'm a little unsure about the scope of work I should consider - should it mainly be things that I considered doing but didn't end up having time for (e.g analysing weighted dice), or should I focus more on wider-reaching things which I never seriously considered doing (e.g I briefly thought about strategy "regularisation", analogous to machine learning where overly complex strategies are penalised).
* Given there's not much time left, I feel like there's quite a lot still left to write, polish and explain - is that pretty normal at this stage? In particular, I don't think I'll get much time between getting an overall draft and polishing the final result (though I suppose I'm effectively refining as I go).
* Thinking ahead to the next two case studies, I'm not quite sure how to visualise the next two games - in particular, the larger model sizes mean that parameterising different aspects of the game is less feasible, so things like graphs won't be as useful. I think I'll mainly stick with "supplementary" visualisations (e.g the tree-like diagrams for Shut the Box), and use more tables and the like for showing the results.

# Plan for next week

* Get a good start on Liar's Dice - at least get the background done and hopefully write up most of the results, if not all. As far as I'm aware this is my last week of lectures, so I'm hoping I can be full speed ahead on the dissertation for the final two weeks.
