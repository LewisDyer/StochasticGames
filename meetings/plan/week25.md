# Week 25 (Final) Status Report - 06/04/2021

This week I have finished writing up the 3rd case study - all I need to do now is write the overall evaluation (with preprocessing/etc.), the overall conclusion (what sort of design questions can model checking answer/not answer/potential future work?), the introduction, the abstract, cut down a few pages of content, and then record the presentation.

# Questions/Notes

I've uploaded the newest draft to Overleaf, no further questions beyond that

# Plan for this week

Dissertation writing tasks:
* Write the overall evaluation (e.g how did I use preprocessing to ensure my experiments were reproducible? Maybe a little on how model checking improves reproducibility compared to the likes of monte carlo methods?)
* Write the overall conclusion (e.g is model checking effective in game design/balance? what sort of things is it good or bad at?).
* Write the introduction (Why is automated game balancing important? Why is model checking a good tool for this?), along with the abstract

I'm aiming to complete these by Wednesday evening, so I can upload them to Overleaf and we can have a meeting on Thursday as previously discussed to tie up any loose ends.

Other tasks:
* Cut down a few pages of content to fit within 30 pages (3rd case study was shorter than expected, so not sure how much I'll need to cut by the end)
* Record the presentation (shouldn't take too long, a high-level overview/summary of the dissertation)
* Get some final user polish, add a few instructions for the source code, and submit :) The end is in sight...
