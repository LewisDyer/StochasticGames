# Week 20 Status Report - 02/03/21

This week, I've continued work on the development environment for the third game - I can now generate models in bulk, and I've started planning out the properties I want to run. I've also implemented the suggested revisions in the background section of the dissertation.

# Questions/Notes

* Obviously it's still a ways to go, but I've started thinking a bit about the presentation - right now I think the presentation is pretty much just a summary of the dissertation, but I'm not sure if this is accurate (and this will also impact how much time I spend developing the presentation later on).
* When I'm adding diagrams for my dissertation (not plots/results, moreso examples such as automata or trees), are there any particular tools you'd recommend for drawing these in LaTeX? TikZ looks pretty good for my purposes, though I'm concerned it might be difficult to use as diagrams become more complex.
* This is a slightly more general point, but I'm finding it challenging working on development and dissertation writing at the same time - it kind of feels like I hit a bump in the road in one, try and ignore it and switch to the other, then end up with barriers on both sides.

# Plan for next week

* Continue work on development environment, I've managed most of the "hard" stuff for now so I just need to get more properties set up (both making a shell script to run on the cluster and get those properties set up for statistical model checking as well).
* Get more background work done, the revisions took a bit longer to run through than expected... I think for any future feedback it'll be easier to use Overleaf, since in particular it "breaks up" revisions and helps me prioritise them.
