# Week 2 Status Report - 07/10/2020

In the past week, I have setup Zotero for reference managing, created a private repository for the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/LewisDyer/StochasticGames) and committed all work and documentation so far onto GitHub.

I have completed Part 1 and 2 of the PRISM tutorials, becoming more familiar with the PRISM tool and its modelling language. I have also read a paper on [Herman's self-stabilisation algorithm](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/bibitem.php?key=KNP12a) following on from Part 2 of the tutorial, and I have experimented with exporting PRISM models into .dot files which can be visualised, identifying multiple risks particularly when modelling and visualised larger, more complex models.

## Questions

### Project management

* If you'd like access to the GitHub repository, let me know your GitHub username and I can provide you access.

* Should I commit my work on the PRISM tutorials to GitHub? My current thinking is no, since it's not directly relevant to my project work (beyond background knowledge).

* I'm currently a bit concerned about time management - at least based on time so far, I'm currently not doing the ~8 hours a week I'm meant to be doing. Is that normal in the early stages?

* I'm a little unclear on how being combined honours changes the project - my current understanding is it means considering a smaller problem at the same level of depth (e.g consider fewer refinements to a potential model).

### PRISM tutorials

* With more and more states, debugging models becomes very challenging - easy to make small typos that can have subtle yet drastic impact on the model. States seem to be "hard coded" - is there any way to automate/improve on this? Module renaming helps where different modules have very similar behaviour (e.g Herman's self-stabilisation algorithm), but not in more complex cases.
