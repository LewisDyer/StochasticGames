# Week 21 Status Report - 09/03/21

This week, I have finished most of the initial background section, and started work on describing the first case study, including background work on MDPs. I have also expanded the development environment in order to simultaneously prepare a shell file (for more accurate results) and evaluate properties via statistical model checking (for fast results).


# Questions

* Roughly speaking, how long should I expect adversary generation to take on the cluster (say on a 50 space model)? I'm potentially concerned that it ends up being very computationally intensive, given my previous experience with the first game.
* When I'm adding figures into my dissertation, how detailed should the captions be? I've included one figure so far, but I think it might be a bit wordy and I don't want to retread the same points in the caption and the main text. 


# Plan for next week

* Get an initial shell file sent over to double check properties and determine an overall direction for analysis of the third game - current results from statistical model checking seem promising, albeit somewhat limited owing to the small model size/number of dice.
* Continue MDPs background, especially adversary generation.
