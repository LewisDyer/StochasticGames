# Week 11 Status Report - 09/12/20

This week, I have collected more data on ShutTheBox, in particular varying the number of dice in the 12-board variant to investigate the triangular number phenomenon (using 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 dice). I have also started investigating POMDPs, starting background reading, downloading the development version of PRISM with support for POMDPs and investigating several of the built-in examples (especially McCallum's maze problem).

# Questions/Comments

* Given that this development version of PRISM doesn't support strategy generation, is there any way I can still get the optimal strategy for a particular property? (e.g the sequence of moves taken for McCallum's maze problem)

* I noticed there's also no support for simulating paths manually - do you have any particular tips for debugging POMDPs? I found with ShutTheBox that simulations were really helpful, and I'm concerned about showing my game acts as expected without a few simulations. Converting them to MDPs is trivial and could be partially effective, albeit in some models having hidden information has far larger implications than others.

* I'm coming up with ideas for generating opponents in Liar's Dice, and I have two main ideas at the moment: Either define overall strategies for the entire game (e.g playing safe vs playing agressive), or define strategies for each mechanic of the game (e.g deciding whether or not to challenge) and combine these strategies together to generate opponents. I'm not sure which would be better - the latter would certainly lead to more opponents, and could lead to interesting discussion of a game's mechanics (e.g if different approaches to a mechanic don't impact the game very much, that suggests the mechanic's significance needs to be increased), but it would also be more complex and potentially be less focused than having more bespoke opponents. In either case, I think having deliberately simple opponents is good, so that particular parts of the game can be easily explored and discussed.
