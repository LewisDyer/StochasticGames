# Week 11 Status Report - 09/12/20

This week, I have collected more data on ShutTheBox, in particular varying the number of dice in the 12-board variant to investigate the triangular number phenomenon (using 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 dice). I have also started investigating POMDPs, starting background reading, downloading the development version of PRISM with support for POMDPs and investigating several of the built-in examples (especially McCallum's maze problem). In addition, I have started building an initial model of Liar's Dice using a POMDP.

# Questions/Comments

* Minor admin question - given the initial project title is quite broad, would it be possible to alter it slightly to reflect the more focused scope of the project (say, "Modelling and analysis of dice-based stochastic games")?

* Given that this development version of PRISM doesn't support strategy generation, is there any way I can still get the optimal strategy for a particular property? (e.g the sequence of moves taken for McCallum's maze problem)

* I noticed there's also no support for simulating paths manually - do you have any particular tips for debugging POMDPs? I found with ShutTheBox that simulations were really helpful, and I'm concerned about showing my game acts as expected without a few simulations. Converting them to MDPs is trivial and seems effective for some parts of a game, albeit other parts intrinsically rely on hidden information so they're not as effective here.

* When coming up with example opponents for Liar's Dice, I'm struggling with how much complexity to encode. Unlike Shut the Box, it seems unlikely that the optimal strategy is easy to come up with, so I think it would be more effective to focus on very simple strategies (say, calculating the probability of a particular bid being correct without inferring anything from previous bids, then challenging all bids below a certain probability based on the "trust level" of the opponent), so that I can focus on particular mechanics.

* In particular, I think it would be interesting to focus on the idea of the "snowball effect", where gaining an initial advantage early on makes it far more likely that you'll win (since you have more dice available, and hence more information), along with comparing how different opponents handle being in advantage or disadvantage (suggesting that a good strategy adapts to the current game state).

* Along this line of thinking, I had an idea - Liar's Dice occurs over a series of rounds, but the only things that carry over each round are the number of dice each player has, and the starting player. Hence, it may be effective to treat each round of the game as a separate model, then create a binary tree with transitions between different models, and use this tree to calculate winrates and other interesting properties. In some sense, this is analogous to dynamic programming for model checking - each round of the game is a different subproblem, so it would be more efficient to calculate results once and look them up when required, rather than undergo redundant model checking. This binary tree could also be visualised to show interesting information, such as the aforementioned snowball effect.
