# Week 1 Meeting Minutes - 02/10/2020

It was first agreed that future meetings would take place at 1pm on Wednesdays. 
It was agreed that I should upload a short status report of work completed since the last meeting, along with questions for our upcoming meeting, in advance to the Microsoft Teams page. It was also agreed that I should use a private repository on GitHub for version control, making this public when the project has concluded.

I mentioned that I was struggling to create a week by week plan for the project at this stage, and Gethin remarked that at this stage in a project a week by week plan would be far too granular. In particular, Gethin emphasised that model development is an iterative process, where analysis and refinement are often intertwined, and this should be incorporated into my plan.

I asked about the difference between PRISM and PRISM-games, and Gethin said that while PRISM-games is more specialised towards the development work I will be completing, PRISM is more established and more stable, and that I should focus on learning PRISM before moving to PRISM-games.

Gethin mentioned various examples of applications of stochastic games, in particular in security and robotics, and used rock paper scissors to illustrate where probabilisitic strategies can be more effective than pure strategies. I remarked that I was trying to consider some interesting games to study, but that I was too focused on games in the everyday sense. Gethin remarked that William Kavanagh was quite knowledgable in this area, and agreed to speak to him to come up with more examples of interesting games to study.

We concluded the meeting by making a plan for the next several days. Gethin sent me a copy of an industry-focused paper that I should read for a high level overview of quantitative verification, along with a more mathematically-oriented paper that may be of interest. After reading this, I should complete several of the PRISM tutorials, in particular those which introduce the PRISM modelling language.
