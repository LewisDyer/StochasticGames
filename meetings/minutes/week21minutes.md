# Week 21 Minutes - 09/03/21

On adversary generation, Gethin remarked that since obtaining optimal values required generating adversaries, the amount of additional work to obtain an adversary should hopefully be minimal.

On dissertation writing, Gethin suggested that figures generally don't contain any additional information compared to just reading text, but they help considerably in improving understanding, as well as breaking up dense sections of text. The placement of figures can also be somewhat controlled, but I shouldn't be too fussy about this.

Finally, the plan for next week was discussed. I would try and send Gethin a preliminary shell file by Friday, so the results can run over the weekend. I would continue the background section on MDPs, and hopefully start writing up results for Shut the Box. Gethin recommended that I complete each chapter before moving on to the next one, and that I also combine the analysis and evaluation of each case study. This way, the reader won't have to keep referencing previous graphs and figures between the analysis and evaluation section.
