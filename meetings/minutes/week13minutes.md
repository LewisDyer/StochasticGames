# Week 13 Minutes - 12/01/21

The schedule I had provided was reviewed, and on the whole it was feasible, with a few potential suggestions:

* Gethin suggested combining the final evaluation and conclusion together, since questions about the research process tie in closely to the results.
* Gethin noted that the background section may be longer than anticipated - in particular I would need to describe property specification, along with tying in theoretical information about model checking with the specifics of the PRISM language.

After this the plan for next week was discussed. Since I have few courses this week, this would be a good opportunity to focus on modelling 26.2. My aim is to copmlete a significant chunk of the modelling this week, and hopefully complete a final initial version by next week.
