# Week 15 Minutes - 26/01/21

Firstly, the issue of model size was discussed. Gethin recommended I first start by increasing the memory available to PRISM - currently I'm using 4GB but could feasibly go up to about 12GB or so. If this was not successful, a larger machine could be available to me in order to run my model. I expressed concern that this larger machine may not make much of a difference, since the complexity of the model grows exponentially, but agreed that increasing memory would be a good idea to begin with.  

For dealing with ties, Gethin recommended randomly choosing a winner with uniform probability. This ensures that the symmetry of the model is maintained, preventing potentially confusing bugs later.

For reward-based probabilities, Gethin remarked that obtaining the probability of a particular reward value directly was not possible, so a variable in the model itself would be required (although in practice, if such an algorithm for reward values existed, it would add a variable to the model itself anyway).

In regards to citations, Gethin said that the original work should be cited if no additional information is given, but that both sources should be cited if new information is included (including the likes of examples and case studies). If in doubt, both sources should be cited.

Finally, the plan for next week was discussed. I would retry the two player model using more memory, start the preprocessing procedure for the third game, and start writing the background section. In particular, Gethin remarked that it is hard to ascertain the difficulty of writing a particular section until I start writing, but that I should also keep my structure relatively fluid, and make changes and refinments in order to maintain the narrative flow of the dissertation.
