# Week 23 Minutes - 23/03/21


Firstly, the questions I included in the status report were discussed:

* On mentioning PRISM during the case study, Gethin said I should focus on writing what comes naturally for the time being, especially given the page limit, and later on we can discuss what may need to be added or removed.
* Gethin emphasised that having a clear story throughout the dissertation is important, but I should also mention all the work I've completed, even in passing, so that it can be recognised. For instance, some of my work is exploratory in nature, so it can still aid understanding even if I don't go into detail.
* For future work, I should have a mix of "small-scale" future work (e.g what I would have done with 40 credits), and "large-scale" future work.
* Gethin offered some reassurance regarding the remaining time - in particular, that I had iterated on previous chapters as I went, so the amount of work required to go from a "draft" to the final dissertation will be relatively minimal.

Then, several points were discussed regarding the most recent dissertation draft.

* When discussing the probability distribution of each score, I should be careful to emphasise that the maximum and minimum values are *bounds*, not individual strategies! It may be useful to generate strategies which maximise and minimise expected values, export them as MDPs and plot these on the graph. I could also use dotted lines for the bounds to make clear they're not strategies
* Increasing text size for the graphs should improve readability, at least to the size of normal text in the dissertation. I could also consider removing the titles since I have captions, and potentially use a legend in the faceted plot to show information more clearly.
* My idea of showing the tradeoff between expected value and probability of maximum score is sound, but my specific example is not precise - I should try finding another one.

Finally, I confirmed my plan for this week - I would complete the revisions on this draft, start writing up Liar's Dice, and get ready for the final two weeks without lectures. Gethin remarked that, in the final two weeks, meetings could potentially be arranged on Tuesdays and Fridays depending on current progress to account for the additional time spent on the dissertation for the final two weeks.
