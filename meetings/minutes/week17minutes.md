# Week 17 minutes - 09/02/21

First, some aspects of dissertation writing were discussed. The differences between the introduction and background were discussed - the introduction focuses on *why* the project is relevant or useful, while the background focuses on more technical details. As a very general rule of thumb, a subject expert should be able to skip the background section and still understand the entire dissertation. In regards to references, Gethin remarked that I shouldn't worry too much about this at this stage - later on, Gethin can review the citations and suggest alternative sources where they may be more appropriate (e.g if I cite a survey paper, Gethin should suggest the source of that information).

Regarding my plan to drop the weighted dice section, Gethin suggested that I don't rule anything out yet, since the background section is by far the hardest section of the dissertation to write - it's the only section where I write about other people's work rather than my own, so it's hard to write in a "stream of consciousness". That being said, the weighted dice section is certainly nonessential, so dropping it later on would still work out well for the project.

Finally the plan for the next few weeks was discussed - I would aim to complete preprocessing, and continue work on the background section. Since next week is the reading week, there's no meeting next week, and I'm not expected to send a status report either, but I agreed to update Gethin when preprocessing was finished, to establish if the model can be built successfully after the proposed refactoring.
