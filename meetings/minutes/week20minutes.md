# Week 20 Minutes - 02/03/21

Regarding the presentation, Gethin remarked that the presentation is essentially a summary of the project, with a larger focus on high level details and interesting results rather than more technical details. Gethin suggests that the presentation should take relatively little extra work to create, since presentation work has considerable overlap with the dissertation.

When drawing diagrams, Gethin said that TikZ is very powerful, but also rather complex - instead I should focus on using external tools, such as Powerpoint or Inkscape, to generate vector graphics and use these instead, since they are considerably easier to change and modify later on.

On time management, Gethin suggested setting aside specific blocks of time for each aspect of the project, and not allow yourself to work on the other part of a project until a particular task is completed.

On future corrections, I mentioned that the feedback I recieved so far was understandable and useful, but it would probably be easier to move to Overleaf for future feedback. Gethin agreed with this, suggesting this would be easier because very simple revisions (for instance typos) can be completed immediately. I agreed to set up an Overleaf project, and that every week before the supervisor meeting I would update the Overleaf project with my current progress, and let Gethin know when I wanted him to take a look at some new work.

The plan for next week was discussed - I would continue development environment work, and hopefully be in a position to start running results on the cluster. I would also continue the background section of the dissertation, and hopefully get started on the case study specific background for the first game.
