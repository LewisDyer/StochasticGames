# Week 25 Minutes - 06/04/2021


Some questions were raised about the dissertation draft on Overleaf:

* Gethin clarified that expressing the win property as a utility was possible but not required, and would be sensible to leave out for space reasons.
* On the difference between properties for CSGs and MDPs, the main difference is the use of the minimax for CSGs - I should explain this but apart from that mostly refer to previous work for POMDPs and add a reference for more details.

I should also add more work on adversary generation. Ideally, for POMDPs I should mention how the simple strategies are dominated by general strategies, while for CSGs I should justify that model size makes adversary generation unreasonable.

Finally the plan for the remainder of the week has been outlined. My aim is to finish the first draft of dissertation writing by Wednesday evening, then have a meeting on Thursday at 2 to tie up any loose ends. In particular I could move the section on conditional probabilities for Shut the Box to an appendix to make some space.
