# Week 7 Meeting Minutes - 11/11/20

This week's meeting was short, serving as a recap of the preprocessor so far. Gethin remarked that this was fine - short meetings aren't an issue if work is going well, and it's anticipated that our meetings while analysis is being completed will be longer since there's more to discuss.

On preprocessing functions, Gethin remarked that the overall success of the project would be viewed in terms of research output and analysis. For example, while the models should be clear and understandable, and the analysis should be sensible, it's fine if the preprocessing functions are somewhat messy or hard to follow. I'd still like to document the preprocessor sometime down the line (mainly usage instructions), but this is low priority.

On action labels, Gethin double checked that underscores will work in action labels (I've confirmed this myself just after the meeting and just need to modify the preprocessor to account for this).

On the preprocessing functions being inefficient, Gethin said this was fine as long as the function can handle large enough models to allow for interesting analysis (which it can). While I could improve it later on if I found that using larger models would be informative, I shouldn't prioritise it at this stage.

Finally, the week's plan was reviewed and agreed to. I should finish off the preprocessor (including implementing the underscores in action labels as suggested), and start developing an automation environment. My aim with this environment is to complete as much of the groundwork now as possible, which can then be applied to the other games I examine in the future, so I'd like to replicate my previous research notes in a clear, reproducible form.
