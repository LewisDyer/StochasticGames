# Month by Month plan

A less granular plan for the project, broken up into months rather than weeks.  Includes work completed so far.

## Semester 1

# October

Start background reading, gain familiarisation with PRISM. Start modelling Shut the Box with initial basic example.

# November

Build preprocessing tools for creating models automatically, refine Shut the Box model and extend to larger board counts/more dice.
Set up an environment to automate the model building/experiment running/visualisation process. (First two points are crucial, visualisation is less important for now. This doesn't need to be finished in November)
Start modelling Liar's Dice using this existing workflow.
Decide on a 3rd and final game to model

# December

Project "crunch period"

Finish modelling Liar's Dice
Refine and improve experiment automation as needed (especially visualisation if I don't get much done there in November)
Start modelling Game #3 (I don't expect to finish this, but getting a good start that I can receive feedback on is important)

Consider aspects of analysis to link games together (e.g how eacj game responds to different levels of bias in a die)

## Semester 2

Note: I expect I can afford to spend more time on the project in semester 2 (mainly because I'm taking 3 other courses rather than 6 in semester 1). So I shouldn't be afraid to postpone tasks in Semester 1 if necessary

# January

Finish modelling Game #3
Model "linking analysis" between games as required

Maybe start some dissertation writing (fairly light, probably the background chapter if anything. I don't expect this would change much if my analysis changes a little in February)

# February

Polish graphs, tidy up analysis, aim to completely finish development around this time.

Transition focus to dissertation writing - I think that developing a "skeleton" of the entire dissertation would be helpful, since I want to make sure my three games have a consistent narrative linking them together.

Start fleshing out each chapter in more detail - I should make sure to receive feedback as I work on chapters, so I can take that feedback, improve that chapter, and use that feedback to improve the next game I write about.

If I get time (maybe as a break from dissertation writing?), plan out my presentation

# March

Virtually all dissertation work - finish the dissertation, make sure the chapters fit together nicely when they're all polished in isolation.
Finish planning and record my presentation
