This is a repository for my 4th year individual project at the University of Glasgow, about modelling and analysing stochastic games, supervised by Dr. Gethin Norman.

An overview of the current structure of the repository:
* `dissertation` - contains all files and resources for writing the dissertation.
* `meetings` - contains minutes of each supervisor meeting so far, along with a plan of what to discuss in the meeting and my progress so far.
* `presentation` - files and resources relating to the presentation.
* `src` - source code relating to the project.
* `status_report` - files and resources relating to the formal status report completed at the end of Semester 1.
* `plan.md` - a week by week plan of work to undergo throughout the dissertation. (Currently incomplete, but will be completed within the next several weeks)
* `timelog.md` - a log of all time spent on the project.
