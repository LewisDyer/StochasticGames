# Readme

This folder contains PRISM code for all of the case study models I'm developing.

An overview of the current folder structure:
* `ShutTheBox` - models for the Shut the Box game.
* `utils` - a collection of Python scripts designed to automate the process of generating PRISM models. (model-specific processing is provided in that model's folder, while the `utils` folder focuses on common aspects of preprocessing).

## Build instructions

**You must** include the instructions necessary to build and deploy this project successfully. If appropriate, also include 
instructions to run automated tests. 

### Requirements

List the all of the pre-requisites software required to set up your project (e.g. compilers, packages, libraries, OS, hardware)

For example:

* PRISM-games 3.0
* Tested on Windows 10

### Test steps

Open the model files in PRISM-games (extension `.prism`), along with the property files (extension `.props`), then run experiments and verify properties.

(N.B a script to automatically run experiments and generate graphs will be added in the future)
