\chapter{Background (3 pages)}

Give context on existing work, both in model checking and in automated game design (RMT coursework very helpful for this). Identify a gap in current work (e.g certain types of games that haven't been analysed very much, or discussion on robustness of models). How can I tie this into my project?

Note: don't go into specific details about model types here (MDPs/POMDPs/CSGs) - leave them to later on.

The very key points I need to mention:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Probabilistic model checking
    \item PRISM specifics
    \item Property specification
    \item Stochastic games
    \item Previous work in automated game balancing
    \item Gap in current work (e.g focus on dice/hidden information/weighted dice?)
\end{itemize}
