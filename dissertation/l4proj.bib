Models of games under design can be used for the early evaluation of properties related with game duration, existence of different successful strategies, and balancing of the game core mechanics. To show the usefulness of model checking in game design we consider and develop three case studies in which model checking is used to answer specific game design questions.},

	doi = {10.1109/tg.2019.2943227},
	abstract = {Probabilistic model checking can overcome much of the complexity inherent in balancing games. Game balancing is the careful maintenance of relationships between the ways in which a game can be played, to ensure no single way is strictly better than all others and that players are offered a wide variety of ways to play successfully. We introduce a novel approach towards automating game balancing using probabilistic model checking called chained strategy generation (CSG). This involves generating chains of adversarial strategies which mimic the way players adapt their approach during repeated plays of a game. We use CSG to map out the evolving metagame. The trends identified can allow game developers to identify strategies which will be too strong and ways of playing the game which a player may want to use, but are never viable for successful competitive play. We introduce a case study, a game called RPGLite, and use CSG to compare five candidate configurations for the game. We show how to determine which configurations of RPGLite lead to a more fair and interesting experience for players. We also identify unexpected trends in how the strategies evolve. Our approach introduces a new technique for improving game development and player experience.},

	title = {Evaluating competitive game balance with restricted play},
	abstract = {Game balancing is the fine-tuning phase in which a functioning game is adjusted to be deep, fair, and interesting. Balancing is difficult and time-consuming, as designers must repeatedly tweak parameters, and run lengthy playtests to evaluate the effects of these changes. If designers could receive immediate feedback on their designs, they could explore a vast space of variations, and select only the most promising games for playtesting. Such automated design feedback has been difficult to achieve, as there is no mathematical formulation of game balance that unifies many of its forms. We argue for a formulation in which carefully restricted agents are played against standard agents. We develop this restricted-play balance framework, and evaluate its utility by building a tool capable of calculating measures of balance for a large family of games. By applying this tool to an educational card game, we demonstrate how the framework and tool allow designers to rapidly evaluate and iterate on the balance of their games.},

	title = {Automatic design of balanced board games},
	abstract = {AI techniques are already widely used in game software to provide computer-controlled opponents for human players. However, game design is a more-challenging problem than game play. Designers typically expend great effort to ensure that their games are balanced and challenging. Dynamic game-balancing techniques have been developed to modify a game-engine's parameters in response to user play. In this paper we describe a first attempt at using AI techniques to design balanced board games like checkers and Go by modifying the rules of the game, not just the rule parameters. Our approach involves the use of a commercial general game-playing (GGP) engine that plays according to rules that are specified in a general game-definition language. We use a genetic algorithm (GA) to search the space of game rules, looking for turn-based board games that are well balanced, i.e., those that the GGP engine in self-play finds equally hard to win from either side and rarely draws. The GA finds better games than a random-search strategy that uses equivalent computational effort.},

The logic extends the temporal logic CTL by Emerson, Clarke and Sistla with time and probabilities. Formulas are interpreted over discrete time Markov chains. We give algorithms for checking that a given Markov chain satisfies a formula in the logic. The algorithms require a polynomial number of arithmetic operations, in size of both the formula and the Markov chain. A simple example is included to illustrate the algorithms.},
