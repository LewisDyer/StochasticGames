%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
    This project investigates the viability of using model checking through the probabilistic model checker PRISM in order to evaluate the game design of various games of chance involving dice. We consider three different case studies, including a hidden information game and a game with simultaneous action selection. We use model checking to identify flaws in the game presented in each case study, including the complexity of optimal strategies compared to simpler strategies with similar effectiveness, and the disproportionate influence of early actions in the overall result of a game.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my gratitude to Dr.~Gethin Norman, my project supervisor, for his continual support and guidance throughout the project. I would also like to thank William Kavanagh for offering several useful suggestions throughout the project. Finally, I would like to thank my parents for their encouragement and support throughout what has been a rather eventful year.

%% Notes on formatting
%==============================================================================
% The first page, abstract and table of contents are numbered using Roman numerals and are not
% included in the page count. 
%
% From now on pages are numbered
% using Arabic numerals. Therefore, immediately after the first call to \chapter we need the call
% \pagenumbering{arabic} and this should be called once only in the document. 
%
% Do not alter the bibliography style.
%
% The first Chapter should then be on page 1. You are allowed 40 pages for a 40 credit project and 30 pages for a 
% 20 credit report. This includes everything numbered in Arabic numerals (excluding front matter) up
% to but excluding the appendices and bibliography.
%
% You must not alter text size (it is currently 10pt) or alter margins or spacing.
%
%
%==================================================================================================================================
%
% IMPORTANT
% The chapter headings here are **suggestions**. You don't have to follow this model if
% it doesn't fit your project. Every project should have an introduction and conclusion,
% however.

\chapter{Conditional probability of board coverings in Shut the Box}
\label{app:cond_prob_figure}

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/ShutTheBox/stb12_2d6_score_given_board_12.pdf}
    \caption{The conditional probability of each board being covered in Shut the Box given the final score, in the standard variant under the high-board strategy.}
\label{cs1:stb12_2d6_cond_prob}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{cs1:stb12_2d6_cond_prob} shows the probability of each board being covered in Shut the Box, given a particular final score. Every board has a positive correlation with the final score - this is as expected, since higher scores typically cover more boards. However, this positive correlation is much stronger for higher value boards, suggesting that high value boards are strong indicators for high scores in Shut the Box.
